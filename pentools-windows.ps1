## TODO: - Figure out remote install
#        - can i get it signed? so AMSI doesn't have a hissy fit.
#        - follow best practice
#        - detect user
#        - install in Appdata (home directory)
#        - Leverage wget? do we need curl?
#        - Minimal bloat -- Windows takes 40GB itself, use as much inbuilt as you can, dont bloat the system
#        - add defender exception for directory?
#        - How do I make a variable?
#        - How do functions work?
#        - utilize GIT without a GUI in Windows

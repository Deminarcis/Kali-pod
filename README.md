pentest-tools
====================

Forked from madmantm.

Script to install security tools, and other required tools for penetration testing and network auditing on your system without the need to fidget with a VM and pass off USB or PCI devices

To install extract anywhere and use:
```
chmod +x install-pentest-tools.sh

./install-pentest-tools.sh.

```
Tools are installed in /opt in a folder of your choosing

*Any suggestions to add more tools please don't hesitate to contact or open an issue*
*This will be maintained to the best of my ability.*
*This repo purely serves as a way for me to track and make the changes for this script to work for me and my use case*

Requirements
====================
About 20-30gb of disk space

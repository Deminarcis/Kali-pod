#### Pentest-tools

Forked from madmantm.

Script to install security tools, and other required tools for penetration testing and network auditing on your system without the need to fidget with a VM and pass off USB or PCI devices

To install, extract anywhere and use:
```
chmod +x install-pentest-tools.sh

./install-pentest-tools.sh.

```
Tools are installed in /opt in a folder of your choosing with the exception of tools pulled in for Arch, they are system-wide.

Updated to include BlackArch.... just in-case you use Arch
Aimed at latest Ubuntu and/or Fedora releases

*Any suggestions to add more tools please don't hesitate to contact or open an issue*
*This will be maintained to the best of my ability.*
*This repo purely serves as a way for me to track and make the changes for this script to work for me and my use case*

This doesn't work on Windows. I'm not even a little sorry.

Requirements
====================
About 20-30gb of disk space

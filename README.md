#### Pentools

Forked from madmantm.

This is a script to install Penetration testing tools, which are useful for network auditing among other things. I dont condone the use of this script to do horrible things to horrible/not horrible people. I am not responsible for your actions , so you do you.
I put this together because I got tired of installing a VM then passing off USB devices, which can be difficult from a Laptop PC due to I/O restrictions

To install, clone the repo and use:
```
chmod +x pentools<variant>.sh

sudo ./pentools<variant>.sh

```

Tools are installed in /opt in a folder of your choosing with the exception of tools pulled in for Arch, they are system-wide.

Updated to include BlackArch.... just in-case you use Arch
Aimed at latest Ubuntu and/or Fedora releases

*Any suggestions to add more tools please don't hesitate to contact or open an issue*
*This will be maintained to the best of my ability.*
*This repo purely serves as a way for me to track and make the changes for this script to work for me and my use case*

This doesn't work on Windows. I'm not even a little sorry.

Requirements
====================

## Pentools


Forked from madmantm.

This is a script to install Penetration testing tools, which are useful for network auditing among other things. I don't condone the use of this script to do horrible things to horrible/not horrible people. I am not responsible for your actions , so you do you.
I put this together because I got tired of installing a VM then passing off USB devices, which can be difficult from a Laptop PC due to I/O restrictions. This used to target a bunch of things... now it's just Fedora.


---
To install, clone the repo and use:
```
chmod +x pentools.sh

sudo ./pentools.sh

```
---
Tools are installed in /opt in a folder of your choosing.

*Any suggestions to add more tools please don't hesitate to contact or open an issue*
*This will be maintained to the best of my ability.*
*This repo purely serves as a way for me to track and make the changes for this script to work for me and my use case*

This doesn't work on Windows. Not even a little... Sorry.
